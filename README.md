# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The WTWR (What to Wear?) back-end project focuses on building a server for the app. This project deepened my understanding of working with databases, setting up security, testing, and deploying apps. The goal was to create a server with API and user authorization for the app's front-end.

## Project Functionality 

* User Authentication: Register, log in, and manage user sessions.
* Clothing Item Management: Create, delete, and manage clothing items.
* Likes: Like or unlike items.

## Technologies Used

* Node.js
* Express
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
* ESLint for linting

## Running the Project
`npm run start` — to launch the server 

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature
